## Running the server

ðŸ’¡ Run the server on the command line just typing the following command:

<code>php -S localhost:8000</code>

After That, it will show at the terminal something like that:

<code>[Thu Feb 28 18:54:51 2021] PHP 7.4.3 Development Server (http://localhost:8000) started</code>

Now you can click on the link and you will see the application running!
