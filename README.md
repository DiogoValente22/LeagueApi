## ðŸ’» Running the server

ðŸ’¡ Run the server on the command line just typing the following command:

<code>php -S localhost:8000</code>

After That, it will show at the terminal something like that:

<code>[Thu Feb 28 18:54:51 2021] PHP 7.4.3 Development Server (http://localhost:8000) started</code>

Now you can click on the link and you will see the application running!

## ðŸ“Œ
When you open the web page it will show as default the player "kami", a former professional player from Brazil. To change the player, just type the summoner name in the search field at the top of the page.

<pre><strong>Note 1</strong>
This application is just for fun and to pratice PHP. Maybe soon i will update the html/css to have a more pleasant look.<br>
<strong>Note 2</strong>
for now, only the BR (Brazilian) server has been implemented. Soon I will implement the other servers.<br>
